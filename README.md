# Python-Repo
Here, I have uploaded some of my python projects to practice my fundamentals.
- [Project 1: **Date ADT** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/DateADT.py)
  This is a proleptic Gregorian calendar which shows you the day, month and year including day of the week.
- [Project 2: **Rock paper scissor** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/rock_paper_scissor.py)
  This file contains the rock paper scissor game in python. Hope you guys enjoy it while playing!
- [Project 3: **Email slicer** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/email_slicer.py)
  A program that takes particular email and slices it into the username, domain and extension.
- [Project 4: **Leap year checker** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/leap_year_checker.py)
  A simple program that checks whether the particular year is a leap year or not.
- [Project 5: **Quiz game** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/quiz_game.py)
  This program asks a bunch of questions to the user. If they give the right answer to the question we'll add one to their score. At the 
  end we'll calculate their result. 
- [Project 6: **Number guessing game** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/number_guessing_game.py)
  In this program, we are going to generate a random number and we are going to track how many times it takes the user to guess this 
  number.
- [Project 7: **Basic calculator** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/calculator.py)
  In this program, we are going to build a simple calculator in python.
- [Project 8: **Email Validation in Python (Using string functions)** -](https://github.com/Maryam0330/Python-Repo/blob/main/email_validation.py)
  In this program, we are going to check whether the entered email is valid or not.
