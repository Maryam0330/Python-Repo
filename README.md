# Python-Repo
Here, I have uploaded some of my python projects to practice my fundamentals.
- Project 1: *Date ADT* -
  This is a proleptic Gregorian calendar which shows you the day, month and year including day of the week.
- Project 2: *Inheritance* -
  This file shows you how the child class (derive class) inherits properties from the parent class (base class) using the three types of inheritance such as single, multiple and multilevel.
- Project 3: *Rock paper scissor* -
  This file contains the rock paper scissor game in python. Hope you guys enjoy it while playing!
- Project 4: *Email slicer* -
  A program that takes particular email and slices it into the username, domain and extension.
- Project 5: *Leap year checker* -
  A simple program that checks whether the particular year is a leap year or not.
- Project 6: *Quiz game* -
  This program asks a bunch of questions to the user. If they give the right answer to the question we'll add one to their score. At the end we'll calculate their result. 
- Project 7: *Number guessing game* -
  In this program, we are going to generate a random number and we are going to track how many times it takes the user to guess this number.
