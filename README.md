# Python-Repo
Here, I have uploaded some of my python projects to practice my fundamentals.
- Project 1: *Date ADT* -
  This is a proleptic Gregorian calendar which shows you the day, month and year including day of the week.
- Project 2: *Inheritance* -
  In this program, we are going to see how the child class (derive class) inherits properties from the parent class (base class) using the three types of inheritance such as single, multiple and multilevel.
- Project 3: *Rock paper scissor* -
  This file contains the rock paper scissor game in python. Hope you guys enjoy it while playing!
- Project 4: *Email slicer* -
  A program that takes particular email and slices it into the username, domain and extension.
- Project 5: *Leap year checker* -
  A simple program that checks whether the particular year is a leap year or not.
- Project 6: *Quiz game* -
  This program asks a bunch of questions to the user. If they give the right answer to the question we'll add one to their score. At the end we'll calculate their result. 
- Project 7: *Number guessing game* -
  In this program, we are going to generate a random number and we are going to track how many times it takes the user to guess this number.
- Project 8: *Basic calculator* -
  In this program, we are going to build a simple calculator in python.
- Project 9: *Email Validation in Python (Using string functions)* -
  In this program, we are going to check whether the entered email is valid or not.
