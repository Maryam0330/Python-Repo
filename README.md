# Python-Repo
Here, I have uploaded some of my python projects to practice my fundamentals.
- Project 1: *Date ADT* -
  This is a proleptic Gregorian calendar which shows you the day, month and year including day of the week and also shows whether the year is a leap year or not. This code is written using the Python language.
- Project 2: *Inheritance* -
  This file shows you how the child class inherits properties from the parent class using the three types of inheritance such as single, multiple and multilevel.
